## :pencil: About

The **UnityWidgetsToolkit** will allow you to create a user interface using widgets similar to Flutter's approach, but with a built-in data binding mechanism.

You can use a counter sample to try out this approach of creating UI. The sample is just a prototype to test the idea. The final solution will have a slightly different workflow.

#### Supposed workflow:
- Create UI using widgets
- Provide data-binding using [UnityMvvmToolkit](https://github.com/ChebanovDD/UnityMvvmToolkit)
- Generate `uxml` file to avoid performance impact
